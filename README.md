# R4Z0R-PORTSCAN
## A port scanning tool for Windows, you can scan a certain number of ports, and you get their current status printed as a table in the console.

This is my first larger and more practical tool for hacking, I myself only white hat hacking and therefore emphasize:

> The use of the tool is only legal if the IP addresses or websites you scan are your own, or you have a written permission to scan them! A portscan is otherwise not legal! And you may be liable for it! 

## How does the Tool work?

The tool works quite simply! You enter the IP address for which you want to perform a scan! Then you enter which is the first port you want to scan, and which is the last port you want to scan! It will then scan all ports between the first and the last, and it will check if one of these ports is open. The results are then sent to the console in table form at the end of the scan! 

## Important Note:

> The performance of the scans can vary greatly depending on the connection speed and quantity! On average, a scan can take several minutes! So don't be surprised if it takes a few minutes until the table is displayed. I have also added a small progress bar, so you can see how many ports have been scanned!

If there are any recommendations or suggestions for improvement I would be very happy about it!
