# R4Z0R-PORTSCAN
## A port scanning tool for Windows, you can scan a certain number of ports, and you get their current status printed as a table in the console.

This is my first larger and more practical tool for hacking, I myself only white hat hacking and therefore emphasize:

> The use of the tool is only legal if the IP addresses or websites you scan are your own, or you have a written permission to scan them! A portscan is otherwise not legal! And you may be liable for it!
